						<strong>The clockmaker's Apprentice</strong>
					</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 10px">
						In a quiet mountain village nestled between the pines, lived an old
						clockmaker named Mr. Harwin. Known for his intricate timepieces,
						Harwin was respected but solitary—his shop filled with ticking
						marvels and stories never told. One morning, a boy named Eli, with
						smudged glasses and an insatiable curiosity, knocked on his door.
						<br /><br />
						“I want to learn how to fix time,” Eli said.<br />
						Harwin chuckled. “You mean build clocks?”<br />
						“No,” Eli replied. “Fix time. Make it count.”<br /><br />
						Amused, Harwin accepted him as an apprentice. Day after day, Eli
						learned to carve gears, align springs, and listen—not just to the
						ticks of clocks, but to the rhythm of life. At first, his hands
						trembled. He broke more than he fixed. But Harwin never scolded him.
						“Precision grows from patience,” he’d say.
					</p>
					<br /><br />

					One snowy afternoon, Harwin fell ill. The village panicked—a large
					town bell had stopped, and it was tradition to ring it during the
					Winter Festival. “Without that bell,” a villager said, “the festival
					can’t begin.” Everyone turned to Eli.<br /><br />
					Trembling, Eli entered Harwin’s workshop alone. He studied the bell’s
					mechanism. Remembering everything—the balance, the weight, the
					patience—he worked through the night. By dawn, his fingers were
					blistered, but the bell’s hammer was ready.<br /><br />
					As the sun rose, the bell rang through the village. Cheers erupted.
					The festival began, brighter than ever.<br />
					Harwin, weak but smiling, whispered, “You didn’t just fix a bell. You
					fixed time—for everyone.”<br /><br />
					Years later, Eli became the village’s clockmaker. But he taught more
					than mechanics. He taught children to see wonder in small gears, the
					value of quiet effort, and that even when time seems broken, it can be
					rebuilt—with hope and heart.
